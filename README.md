Ai-FixIT Project Overview
Inspiration
Electronic waste is skyrocketing globally, 62 million tonnes of e-waste were produced in 2022, a record high that continues to grow by 2.6 million tonnes annually.
Most people also struggle to troubleshoot their devices efficiently, which often leads to unnecessary disposal.
We wanted to create a solution that not only solves technical issues quickly but also promotes sustainability by encouraging repair and recycling.

What it does
Ai-FixIT is an AI-powered IT assistant that:

Diagnoses device problems instantly
Provides step-by-step guidance for repairs
Suggests ways to recycle or repurpose electronics
It helps users repair their devices, reduce e-waste, and save both time and money.

How we built it
Combined the Gemini API with a user-friendly interface to detect and troubleshoot hardware and software issues
Integrated computer vision to provide live context for the AI agent, allowing it to better understand user queries
Challenges we ran into
Connecting the Gemini Agent to Eleven Labs
Developing the computer vision component to provide live data for accurate troubleshooting
Integrating sustainable repair and recycling guidance seamlessly into troubleshooting
Accomplishments we're proud of
Developed a working AI assistant capable of diagnosing and guiding repairs for multiple device types
Implemented a sustainability-first approach that actively reduces e-waste
Positive early user feedback showing increased confidence in DIY repairs
What we learned
AI dramatically accelerates troubleshooting, but usability must remain human-centered
Sustainability features resonate strongly with users and can be integrated without affecting performance
Iterative testing and user feedback are crucial to handle diverse devices and real-world issues effectively
What's next for Ai-FixIT
Expand the AI knowledge base to cover more devices and complex issues
Introduce predictive maintenance to prevent problems before they occur
Build community features to share DIY repair tips and recycled solutions
Partner with recycling programs to make eco-friendly device disposal seamless
